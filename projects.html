  <h1>Diabetes Simulator</h1>
  <h3>Purpose</h3>
  <p>The idea behind this simulation is to bring awareness to <b>medical exploitation</b>.
    A good friend of mine has diabetes and seeing everything she has gone through is what
    motivated me to do this. Insulin and medical supplies necessary for proper diabetes management
    are really expensive. For those who do not have medical insurance managing their diabetes can be
    extremely difficult. Insulin is a life-sustaining medication. It should not be
    hard to get affordable insulin and supplies. 
  </p>

  <p>The simulation gives the user a few options in the beginning that will affect how they
  manage their diabetes. For example, yearly income/monthly expenses affect how much money the user
  gets for supplies/medication. There is also an option for health insurance. This affects what kind of
  supplies are available to the user at a discount price.

  <h1>Pain Recognition(Machine/Deep Learning)</h1>
  <h3>Purpose</h3>
  <p>Train a network to make accurate predictions of pain based on physiological data and images of subjects. The subjects received
    stimulation meant to create emotional responses such as joy, sadness, and pain.
  </p>

  <p><b>Phase 1:</b> Using physiological signals from 140 subjects,we used a random forest and support-vector
              machine for training/testing pain recognition.
     <br><b>Phase 2:</b> Using images from 140 subjects, we used a CNN for training/testing pain recognition.
     <br><b>Phase 3:</b> A fusion of the first 2 phases. Using all applicable data to train/detect pain or no pain in subjects.
