  <h1>Diabetes Simulator</h1>
  <h3>Purpose</h3>
  <p>The idea behind this simulation is to bring awareness to <b>medical exploitation</b>.
    A good friend of mine has diabetes and seeing everything she has gone through is what
    motivated me to do this. Insulin and medical supplies necessary for proper diabetes management
    are really expenisve. For those who do not have medial insurance managing their diabetes can be
    extremely diffcult. Insulin is a life sustaining medication. It should not be
    hard to get affordable isulin and supplies.
  </p>

  <p>The simulation gives the user a few options in the beginning that will affect how they
  manage thier diabetes. For example, yearly income/monthly expenses affects how much money the user
  gets for supplies/medication. There is also an option for health insurance. This affects what kind of
  supplies are avaiable to the user at a discount price.
