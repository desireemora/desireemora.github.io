    There's something about music that speaks to me. It sounds cheesy I know
    but I can't explain it any other way. By no means am I claiming to be a
    brilliant musician/composer (If you listen to my stuff then you'll know what
    I mean). All I'm saying is that I love it and hope to
    continue learning and creating.
